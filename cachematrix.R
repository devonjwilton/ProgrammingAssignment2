## makeCacheMatrix is a function that initializes two objects (x and inv) and creates four functions (set, get, setinv, getinv).
## Set allows the matrix being used to calculate the inverse to be changed without reinitializing the makeCacheMatrix function by
## passing the argument for set (y) to the parent environment and setting "x" to this value. It also resets the inverse to NULL so that
## when the matrix is changed any inverse value that has been calculated is also reset. Get and getinv return the matrix and matrix inverse, respectively,
## and setinv sets the inverse matrix using an argument passed from cacheSolve.
## CacheSolve takes the object containing makeCacheMatrix as an input and checks to see if an inverse has been calculated for the matrix
## stored as x in makeCacheMatrix. If an inverse is already stored cacheSolve says that it's retrieving the cached data and returns
## the inverse matrix. If no inverse matrix has yet been calculated, cacheSolve solves for the inverse matrix and then sets the inverse
## using setinv, so that next time the inverse is called (assuming the matrix has not been changed), it does not need to be calculated again.
